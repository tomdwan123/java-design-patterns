### Welcome to Design Pattern

#### List Patterns
- Solid
  - Single Responsibility Principle
    - A class should only have one reason to change
    - Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems
  - Open-Closed Principle
    - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
  - Liskov Substition Principle
    - You should be able ti substitute a base type for a subtype
  - Interface Segregation Principle
    - Don't put too much into an interface, split into separate interfaces
    - YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It
  - Dependency Inversion Principle
    - High level modules should not depend upon low-level ones, user abstractions
- Creation
  - Builder
    - Some  are simple and can be created in s single constructor call
    - Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create
    - Having an object with 10 constructor arguments is not productive
    - Instead, opt for piecewise construction
    - Builder providers an API for constructing an object step-by-step
  - Factories
    - Abstract Factory
    - Factory Method
  - Prototype
  - Singleton
- Structural
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy
- Behavioural
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Command
  - Interpreter
  - Iterator
  - Mediator
  - Memento
  - Null Object
  - Observer
  - State
  - Strategy
  - Template Method
  - Visitor
